    <h5>SF Open Art</h5>
    I spend a lot of my free time supporting artists in the San Francisco community. One app I wanted to prototype for them would allow people to find their works through the help of Google Maps. With the help of the SF OpenData city database, I created an app that can load all civic art locations in San Francisco onto a map. Users can search for displays that are nearby their current location, view projects around a certain address, and pull up pieces by artist.
